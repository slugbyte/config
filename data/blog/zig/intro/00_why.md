I have been developing with Javascript as my goto for about 10 years. It was the
language that unlocked a love for programming in me. 
When I first started to learn programming, I
tried Java, c, ObjectiveC, and swift before I tried JS. I learned some suuuper
funtamentals from these languages, but I was deeply stuck. I had already spent a few
years trying to learn programming, but I still had no idea how to turn an empty
folder into an application. I was basicly slogging around in tuttorial hell. I could
easily follow instructions to achieve an outcome of someone elses design, but I didn't
really understand things on my own. That all began to change when I stared
learning Javascript.

I attribute a lot of the fast learning to the fact that JS/Node.js was the lowest 
friction developer expierience I had encountered. 
* JS was the first language that I used which had a REPL
    * it was amazing to be able to spin up node and test out ideas.
    * For one thing, I am a very dyslexic and learning by reading explantions
      rarly translates to things sticking in my memory.
      I often learn by brute force, try something -> fail -> tweek and repeat.
    * The REPL was lowest friction environment i had encountered for this type
      of learning. No insane IDE config tweeking, no compile times, vm bootings or
      flashing phones, just type code and immedialy see what happens. It was
      fucking awesome.
* Contrary to all the JS memes out there, I loved the lack of static typing and all the automatic coersion. 
At the time, I basicly didn't
know how or when to use what `type`s to solve what probelms. It was super
freeing at the time to expierament with data without having to care about static type syntax.
* The event loop felt super easy to utalize. In fact it was so easy to use, i
  didn't event know I was using it for a while, and once I understood it better
  through expieramentaiton it unlocked a lot of ideas about async problems and
  solutions for me.
* node std library was simple and small enough that i could read all the docs in
  a weekend.
* finnaly using npm to find and manage packages was so convienent. I loved
  finding librarys on npm and then reading through there package.json
  dependecies to figure out what those librarys where using. I loved looking up
  things on npm and then jumping into github, and seeing if i counld understand
  the implamentation well enough that i could roll my own,

My introduction to Javascript was through Node.js. Node was the first DX that I
could wrap my mind around. I could easily find librarys and install them with
npm. 

through after break trough. In a matter of months I was able to break finnaly 
break down real world problems into software and build clis, apis, and web frontends
that. A huge part of that was learning how to model data into JS objects,
arrays, strings, and numbers. I suddenly could look at an application and makeup
a spec for some data that could be used to reproduce that application. I also
stated to think about IO, events, and 

So hear I am 10 years later, and I have differnt needs, interests, and
limitiations. 

I recently heard someone refer to the past few years as the cambrian explosion of
programming languages. Every few months I hear about new languages and runtimes
being developed, that are called the `____` killers. bun the node killer,
nu-shell the shell killer, kotlin the java killer, go the python killer, rust the
blazingly fast killer of killers, yada yada yada. Each time I hear of something
new my interest is peeked.

I have been bored and unsatisfied with the languages I've been using, for a few
years now. I have primarly solved all my probles with Javascript for the last 10
years.

I have been unsatisfied and bored with the state of my own knowledge as a
software developer. There are so manythings I want to accomplish that I have
