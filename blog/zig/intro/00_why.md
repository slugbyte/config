I have been developing with Javascript for about 10 years. I am super greatfull 
to everything it has taught me. When I first wanted to learn programming, I
tried Java, c, ObjectiveC, and swift before I tried JS. I learned some suuuper
funtamentals from these languages, but I was deeply stuck. I had spent a few
years trying to learn programming, but I still had no idea how to turn an empty
folder into an application. I was basicly slogging around tuttorial hell. I could
easily follow instructions to achieve an outcome of someone elses design, but I didn't
really understand things on my own. That all began to change when I stared
learning Javascript.

When I stated learning JS with Node.js, I had break
through after break trough. In a matter of months I was able to break finnaly 
break down real world problems into software and build clis, apis, and web frontends
that. A huge part of that was learning how to model data into JS objects,
arrays, strings, and numbers. I suddenly could look at an application and makeup
a spec for some data that could be used to reproduce that application. I also
stated to think about IO, events, and 

So hear I am 10 years later, and I have differnt needs, interests, and
limitiations. 

I recently heard someone refer to the past few years as the cambrian explosion of
programming languages. Every few months I hear about new languages and runtimes
being developed, that are called the `____` killers. bun the node killer,
nu-shell the shell killer, kotlin the java killer, go the python killer, rust the
blazingly fast killer of killers, yada yada yada. Each time I hear of something
new my interest is peeked.

I have been bored and unsatisfied with the languages I've been using, for a few
years now. I have primarly solved all my probles with Javascript for the last 10
years.

and the
I have been unsatisfied and bored with the state of my own knowledge as a
software developer. There are so manythings I want to accomplish that I have
long felt are out of my reach.

The thing is
I have dabbled in many of the `*`langs that have poped up,
