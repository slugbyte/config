Create a comprehensive markdown recap of this OpenCode session about "$NAME" and save it to a file named with today's date in the format: `yyyy-mm-dd-$NAME.md`

The recap should include:

## Problem Statement
Clearly describe the problem we were trying to solve in this session. What was the initial challenge or issue?

## Choices Discovered
List the different approaches, solutions, or implementations we considered or discovered during this session. Include pros/cons or why certain approaches were preferred over others.

## Decision Made
Summarize the key decision(s) we made about how to proceed. What did we ultimately choose and why?

## Changes Made
Detail all the actual changes, modifications, or implementations that were made during this session:
- Code changes (files modified, functions added/updated)
- Architecture decisions implemented
- Configuration changes
- Dependencies added/removed
- Any other substantive modifications

Format the recap as clear, well-organized markdown with proper headers and sections. Be concise but thorough. Use code blocks where appropriate to highlight specific implementations or configurations.

When you've generated the recap content, save it to a file with the filename format: `yyyy-mm-dd-$NAME.md` (where yyyy-mm-dd is today's date). For example, if $NAME is "floating-boxes", the file should be named "2026-02-04-floating-boxes.md".
