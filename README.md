# CONFIG

## Dotfiles
* [conf/](./conf) is where i store all my dotiles
    * I link them to the correct locations with the shell script (link.sh)(./conf/link.sh)
* [exec/](./exec) is in $PATH and I keep a few scripts

## $HOME is dead to me
I stopped using my $HOME dir after I got sick of software dumping files and
directorys all up in it. I instead treat ~/workspace or in practice `$w` as my 
home dir.
* code - all my personal programming projects
* data - assets like images, documents, videos, etc.
* play - in progress personal projects (non code related)
* root - i use this to compile and maintain language runtime/compilers (zig, go,
  rust, java)
* temp - temp place to put things util I find a real home for them (screenshots/downloads/etc)
* work - job related stuff
* hist - an archive of past personal projects from my whole life
